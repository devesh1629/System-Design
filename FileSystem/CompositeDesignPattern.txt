COMPOSITE DESIGN PATTERN:

The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern where we have an object inside an object.
This pattern creates a tree structure of a group of objects.

How to implement Composite Pattern ?
It is super easy to implement the Composite design pattern.
Each Composite object (non-leaf only) will have a list of objects of its own base type.
The leaf class does not have any child object whereas the non-leaf class is having a list of composite objects (leaf + non-leaf).
